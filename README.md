## BookSearchEngine
A powerful book search engine built in SQLite (backend) and Python with Tkinter (frontend) was made for book query purpose. Users can look up information about a book such as ISBN, rating, title and author with ease. In the meanwhile, it also allows users to administer the database by adding, deleting and updating any record. The code has been converted to a standalone final product, which is the donwloadable exe application.
